            CSS Solved a Big Problem
            HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
            
            HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
            
            When tags like , and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
            
            To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
            
            CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
